# Protein Master Toolkit
Built a web platform for the protein master toolkit, ASSAP. This was my semester project in the Biology Department of IISER Tirupati. This toolkit aimed to perform the protein sequence analysis and give some insights into its structure. I used Django (Python's web development framework), HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
